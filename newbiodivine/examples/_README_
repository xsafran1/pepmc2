This document informally describes syntax of .bio files. 
==============================================================================

* There are few reserved keywords that cannot be substring of any other 
element in the file. These are: VARS, EQ, TRES, INIT, 'system async', 
REFINETRESH, SIGNIFICANCE, ZERORANGE, and STATICTRESHS. To be 
recognized, keywords must be the first non-white space text on a line.

* Any line starting with # or // is considered a comment and is ignored 
during processing the .bio file.

* First, it is needed to give the set of all used variables. For this 
purpose VARS keyword is reserved. Variables may be specified, e.g., as 
follows: 

 VARS:x,y,z,a1

* Differential equations can be specified as follows. First use keyword 
EQ: followed by d and the name of the variable. In the following 
example, equation is given for variable name x. Note explicit braces 
around negative constants.

 EQ:dx = ( -0.5)*x*y + (-.002)*x + (-0.2)*y + 0.003 

* Thresholds are given using keyword TRES:, thresholds for given variable 
may be given using more TRES keyword each on a separate line. Thresholds 
needn't be ordered.

 TRES:x:1, 3, 5
 TRES:x:0, 2 

* Initial conditions are given as a list of "convex" regions. 
Individual members of the list are specified on separate lines using 
keyword INIT. One region is given as interval on thresholds for every 
variable. Having four variables, two convex regions may be specified as 
indicated below. IMPORTANT: Initials conditions MUST be specified after 
all thresholds have been provided.

 INIT: 0:3, 1.2:3.55, 0.3:1, 3:10
 INIT: 0:1, 0.4:1.2, 0.3:0.6, 3:6


* To be able to automatically combine with LTL properties represented as 
Buchi automata, the following line is obligatory in .bio file.

 system async;


* Optionally, it is allowed to specify significance threshold. 
Significance threshold behaves as an additional guard for all transitions. 
It makes the transition enabled only if its relative size compared to 
the most significant transition emanating from the state is above the 
given threshold. Most significant transition is the one with the largest 
derivation. The significance threshold must be larger than 0 and less or 
equal to 1. If the threshold equals to 1, the system ignore significance 
threshold completely. In the following example, the significance threshold 
is set to 34%. Default value is 1 (significance is not employed).

 SIGNIFICANCE: 0.34

* The state space generation heuristics provided by SIGNIFICANCE option can be further tuned by two probabilistic heuristics that can be additionally turned on by keyword RANDOMIZE. This keyword takes effect only when SIGNIFICANCE keyword is present. Setting RANDOMIZE to 0 is equivalent to the absence of the keyword RANDOMIZE. Setting RANDOMIZE to 1 turns on probabilistically distributed addition of nonsignificant edges. Setting RANDOMIZE to 2 turns on probabilistically distributed addition of nonsignificant edges additionally weighted by distance of respective adjacent thresholds. Default value is 0.

 RANDOMIZE: 1

* The following keyword can be used for further tuning of the probabilistic heuristics. The keyword takes its effect only if RANDOMIZE is set to either 1 or 2. The value set by this keyword is a floating number in (0,1] by which the probability of choosing a nonsignificant transition is additionally multiplied. Default value is 1.

 RNDPARAMETER: 0.5

* Optionally, it is also possible to specify range of values close 
enough to zero to be considered zero. The next line says that all values 
between -0.000000001 to 0.000000001 will be considered as zero values 
when computing the result of derivation.

 ZERORANGE: 1e-9

* REFINETRESH keyword is used to force the tool refine thresholds prior 
state space generation. The value given after the keyword specifies the 
number of iterations, in which the thresholds will be refined. It is not 
recommended to use this option until the user knows what she is doing. Default 
value is 0 (no threshold refinement).

 REFINETRESH: 0

* With the following keyword, it is possible to specify static uniform 
partitioning of a single dimension. To do so, use the keyword with  
the name of a variable, and from, to, and step real numbers. 
Hopefully, the semantics of the numbers is intuitive.

 STATICTRESHS: varname: from, to, step

* The following keyword turns on/off the presence of self-transitions. Self-transitions overapproximate potentially non-transiency of states. Setting SELFLOOPS to 1 sets the self-transitions on. Setting SELFLOOPS to 0 turns self-transitions off. The latter option is the default behaviour.

 SELFLOOPS: 1
