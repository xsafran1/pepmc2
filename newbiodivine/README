This is the package containing BioDiVinE tool (including DiVinE/Library and DiVinE/ToolSet.)

This branch of DiVinE focuses on modeling and analysis of dynamic models of biological systems.
Currently this is an experimental branch of DiVinE that includes the basic kernel 
of DiVinE (the DiVinE library) which extended with state-space generator for biological 
systems. Note that only some of the DiVinE tools are included 
(in modified version to work with the biological extension).
